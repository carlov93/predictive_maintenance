## Residual
In regression analysis, the difference between the observed value of the dependent variable (y) and the predicted value (ŷ) is called the residual (e). Each data point has one residual.

Residual = Observed value - Predicted value 
e = y - ŷ

Both the sum and the mean of the residuals are equal to zero. That is, Σ e = 0 and e = 0.

### Error vs. Residual
- The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the unobservable population mean is a statistical error, whereas
- The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the observable sample mean is a residual.

Note that, because of the definition of the sample mean, the sum of the residuals within a random sample is necessarily zero, and thus the residuals are necessarily not independent. The statistical errors, on the other hand, are independent, and their sum within the random sample is almost surely not zero.
